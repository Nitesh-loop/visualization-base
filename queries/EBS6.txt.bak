1. Custom Index Validation
Identify non-Oracle-standard indexes (common in customized EBS environments):

-- Custom indexes not prefixed with APPS standard
SELECT owner, index_name, table_name 
FROM dba_indexes 
WHERE owner = 'APPS' 
  AND index_name NOT LIKE '%\_PK' ESCAPE '\' 
  AND index_name NOT LIKE '%\_U1' ESCAPE '\' 
  AND index_name NOT LIKE 'FND\_%' ESCAPE '\';
  
  
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_count
FROM dba_indexes 
WHERE owner = 'APPS' 
  AND index_name NOT LIKE '%\_PK' ESCAPE '\' 
  AND index_name NOT LIKE '%\_U1' ESCAPE '\' 
  AND index_name NOT LIKE 'FND\_%' ESCAPE '\';
  
  
total_count

2. Invalid Synonyms
Check for synonyms pointing to non-existent objects:

-- Broken public synonyms in EBS
SELECT owner, synonym_name, table_owner, table_name 
FROM dba_synonyms 
WHERE table_owner IN ('APPS','GL','AP','AR') 
  AND (table_name NOT IN (SELECT object_name FROM dba_objects WHERE owner = table_owner));
  
owner	synonym_name			table_owner		table_name
APPS	AP_PAYMENT_DISTS_MRC_V	AP				AP_PAYMENT_DISTS_MRC_V_ALL
APPS	AP_RECON_DISTS_MRC_V	AP				AP_RECON_DISTS_MRC_V_ALL
